    <p>Zamaransk is a country in central Anteria. It has a population of 20 000 000 people. It was founded in 1972. The country mostly lies in temperate climate. Its capital is Protovsk.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>First mentions of settlements on Zamaransk's territory date back to the 10th century, however the fist time the actual name Zamaransk is mentioned is in a document from 1760. Zamarank was an independent
   kingdom, until it was occupied by Obristan and subsequently integrated into the OUAN (Obristani Union of Allied Nations) in 1847. Zamaransk was renamed to Allied Nation of Zamaransk upon its integration into
   the OUAN. Zamaransk existed in this form until the fall of the OUAN in 1972. After the fall of the OUAN, Zamaransk split off, becoming the current Republic of Zamaransk. Even after splitting off, Zamaransk 
  stayed in the Obristani sphere of influence. This was due to the totalitarian oligarchy which was put into power right in 1972. This oligarchy was overthrown in 2003, when a revolution happened. Since then, 
  Zamaransk has gone onto a liberal path, starting to slowly drift under the influence of the United Federation. Zamaransk joined the UCA (United Countries Alliance) in 2023, sparking a wave of protests from 
  a sustantial part of the population.</p>
  
  <h2>Army</h2>
  <p>The equipment of the Zamaranskian armed forces consists mainly of old weapons from OUAN times, or their moedrnized versions (coming mainly from Chernarus). The weapons are not only badly outdated, but
  also badly maintianed. The combination of these two factors means that the army is almost incapable of dealing with internal threats, and is definitely not ready to defend the country in the event of an
  invasion. For this, Zamaransk relies on the UCA (United Countries Alliance). Anton Karton, Zamaransk's defence minister from 2015 to 2017 said durnig his speech in the parliament that "This country is a
  shitshow, I can't work like this". After saying this, he proceeded to storm out of the parliament building and handed in his resignation, effective immediately. Nowadays, he's enjoying his retirement,
  having moved to sunny Altis. Since his now infamous speech, military spending has increased, however army modernisation is still going slow due to rampant corruption.</p>

  <h2>Politics</h2>
  <p>Zamaransk is a parliamentary republic, with 2 chambers of parliament, 14 ministers a prime minister and a president. Zamaransk's population has problems with brain drain, because the country is
  underdeveloped compared to neighboring countries, with the exception of Obristan. Zamaransk's government is plagued with incompetence and corruption. The current government is trying to fix the issue, but
  the moves to combat them are unpopular, leading to instability. The country that helps Zamaransk the most in battling the protests is Chernarus. Chernarus is overall the closest country to Zamaransk, having
  almost brother-like relations, and also sharing the same language. Zamaransk also has good relations with its neighbors.</p>

  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p>Zamaransk's economy is largely agriculturally based, and Zamaransk is the largest exporter of food in eastern Anteria. Zamaransk's industrial sector has mostly been sold off to western Anterian companies
  after the revolution in 2003. Zamaransk's new government wanted to give the companies more freedom, however this backfired, as the western Anterian companies ravaged the companies for anything useful and then
  run them to the gorund. In the past few years, Zamaransk has become a hotspot for software development.</p>
