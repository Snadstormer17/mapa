  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>First mentions of settlements on Zamaransk's territory date back to the 10th century, however the fist time the actual name Zamaransk is mentioned is in a document from 1760. Zamarank was an independent
   kingdom, until it was occupied by Obristan and subsequently integrated into the OUAN (Obristani Union of Allied Nations) in 1847. Zamaransk was renamed to Allied Nation of Zamaransk upon its integration into
   the OUAN. Zamaransk existed in this form until the fall of the OUAN in 1972. After the fall of the OUAN, Zamaransk split off, becoming the current Republic of Zamaransk. Even after splitting off, Zamaransk 
  stayed in the Obristani sphere of influence. This was due to the totalitarian oligarchy which was put into power right in 1972. This oligarchy was overthrown in 2003, when a revolution happened. Since then, 
  Zamaransk has gone onto a liberal path, starting to slowly drift under the influence of the United Federation. Zamaransk joined the UCA (United Countries Alliance) in 2023, sparking a wave of protests from 
  a sustantial part of the population.</p>
