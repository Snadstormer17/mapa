  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Kolechian history begins in the 8th century, when a bunch of small duchies decided to unify amid the threat of Sevincians from the west. The
  Kolechian kingdom was at its most powerful in the 15th and 16th century, controlling bits of Livonia and Sassaria. However, after this time,
  Kolechia fell in power and influence, until 1847 when Kolechia was absorbed into the OUAN. Kolechia tried to leave the OUAN in 1946,  however their
  attempts were wiped away by the Obristani army. In late 1971, protest began in the streets of Bolensk, demanding freedom. These protests quickly
  spread to other allied nations, and in April of 1972, the OUAN fell. After its dissolution, a despotic dictator called Nicolae Alducescu came into
  power. In 1975, he ordered Kolechia to invade the small island nation of Altis and Stratis. The invasion was successful, and Kolechia occupied Altis
  and Stratis until 1989, 3 years after the death of Alducescu. Altis used the chaos after Alducescu's death to free itself. Alducescu's death
  opened a power struggle, which sparked a civil war. The civil war was very confusing, with multiple warring factions, and multiple superpowers
  funding them. The democratic party won in the end, and Kolechia bolstered its ties to the United Federation by joining the UCA in 1999. In recent
  years however, the public opinion has shifted towards closer cooperation with Obristan, which led to turmoil in the UCA regarding a potential
  leave by Kolechia.</p>

  <h2>Army</h2>
  <p>The Kolechian army uses a mix of both old, but modernized and new equipment. Following the Obristani invasion into Oboliskia in 2009, the
  government started many modernization efforts, but were unwilling to release large amounts of money to actually make them happen. A large part of
  Kolechian army equipment is also outdated equipment donated from the United Federation, sent as part of aid packages in the 2010s.</p>

  <h2>Politics</h2>
  <p>Kolechia is a presidential republic led by Andrei Bucur. In the past few years, the president has begun consolidating power more and more,
  rendering the parliament increasingly powerless. Questions have beeen raised about the distribution of power and an increasing totalitarian
  tendency. Protests have begun to crop up in the last decade in an effort to save democracy, however they have been largely ineffective.</p>

  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p>The Kolechian economy is well diversified, with a leading third sector, especially manufacturing computer parts. Kolechian agriculture is also
  one of the largest in the region. Even though the economy is well diversified, the manufacturing sector is falling behind the standards of
  surrounding countries. Majority of the Kolechian energy industry is dependent and mostly even owned by Obristan. This stranglehold on Kolechia is
  one of the reasons behind the Kolechian move to the Obristani sphere of influence.</p>
