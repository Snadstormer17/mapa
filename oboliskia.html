  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Last of the OUAN countries (quite literally actually), Oboliskian history began only in the 16th century, when a handful of Obristani duchies decided to join forces in making a new and better kingdom. Oboliskia was never a powerhouse in the region, but they could
  stand their ground to larger countries around them. The Oboliskian Kingdom ceased to exist in 1836, when it was joined into the newly forming OUAN. As I've mentioned many times now, the OUAN fell apart in 1972. Countries were leaving one by one. A bizarre thing
  happened on the 28th April 1972 though. At this moment in time, only Obristan and Oboliskia were still in the OUAN. On this day though, Obristan left, leaving Oboliskia as the sole member of the OUAN. It took 4 days until this situation was resolved. 4 days, for which
  Oboliskia WAS the OUAN. Oboliskia left on the 2nd May 1972, closing a big OUAN shaped chapter in the world's history. slova slova slova</p>
